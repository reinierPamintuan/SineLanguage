Text to Morse Code Translation Project

Application Intent:
    Application will transmit data to hardware devices to translate morse code input to text output and visa versa
    Will be web based.
Main Goals:

    a. Act as a learning project for full frontend and backend development
    b. Utilize hardware to the best of our abilities

Current Epics:

    i.  Initial hardware resources will have an LED light/display as it's main source of output
    ii. Webpage should be accessible for input
        iia. A keyboard or similar hardware implementation for transmitting data the other way as a future goal
        
Current User Stories:
    As a User, I want to....
    
    i. send data through a text input
    ii. Send information to a hardware device and have it display
    iii. Have hardware display raw morse code visually
    iv. Have hardware display raw morse code audibly

Current Frameworks are up for discussion:

    LM: I want to try Python and a JS framework for front end and similar processing. "
    Node.js" and maybe java for the backend
